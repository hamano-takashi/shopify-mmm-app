## Short Description (100 chars max)
Marketing Mix Modeling for Shopify. See which ads drive revenue and optimize your budget allocation.

## Detailed Description

### Know exactly which marketing channels drive your revenue.

Stop guessing which ads work. MMM Analytics uses **Marketing Mix Modeling** — the same methodology used by Fortune 500 companies — to measure each channel's true contribution to your revenue.

### How It Works

1. **Connect your data** — Sync Shopify sales automatically, then upload your ad spend data via our Excel template.
2. **Run analysis** — Our OLS regression engine processes your data to separate each channel's impact.
3. **Get actionable insights** — See channel contribution charts, ROAS by channel, and AI-powered budget optimization recommendations.

### Key Features

**Channel Contribution Analysis**
See exactly how much revenue each marketing channel (Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok, LINE, etc.) drives — including the baseline revenue that comes without any advertising.

**Saturation & Marginal ROI** (Pro)
Understand which channels are oversaturated and where additional spend still has high returns. Find the sweet spot for each channel's budget.

**Budget Optimization** (Pro)
Get AI-powered recommendations on how to reallocate your existing budget for maximum revenue lift — without spending a single dollar more.

**Excel Report Export** (Starter+)
Download comprehensive Excel reports with channel breakdowns, ROAS analysis, and optimization recommendations to share with your team.

**Model Accuracy Metrics**
Every analysis includes R² and MAPE scores so you know how reliable the results are. No black boxes.
